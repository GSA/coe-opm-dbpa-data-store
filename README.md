# IT Infrastructure Optimization: OPM Discovery BPA Order (Data Store)

## Announcements

ICF International, Inc. has been awarded the first order off the Discovery BPA for OPM.

## Background

The mission of the Centers of Excellence (CoE), housed within the General Services Administration (GSA), is to accelerate Information Technology (IT) modernization, improve the public experience, and reduce legacy IT spending across the Government. CoE accomplishes this by centralizing top government tech talent, leveraging private-sector best practices, and operating with a teaming mindset across Government departments and agencies. To better align with the dynamic effects of such a transformation, CoE provides a shared service solution for professional services to agencies adopted under the CoE initiative.

One of the components of the CoE’s shared service solution is the Discovery and Assessment Blanket Purchase Agreement (“Discovery BPA”). The Discovery BPA was established to offer CoE Agency Partners with a means of initial and continuous discovery work, through functional area and by Center need, considering the various different factors, influences, and context that applies to each Agency Partner’s organizational transformation needs. Having partnered with CoE, this Discovery BPA order will be utilized to support the mission of U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM).

## Purpose

The OPM IT infrastructure is composed of hundreds of applications, many relying on the same mainframe hosted data stores for their mission critical business functions. This interdependence hinders modernization efforts, effectively preventing the refactoring of one application without breaking the equilibrium of the rest of the ecosystem. CoE’s objective is to create an independent modern data store, that continently synchronizes with the mainframe data sets, accessible via a secure API, will resolve this by allowing incremental introductions of modern technology into the ecosystem without disrupting the legacy systems.
